# SOSFrame

This is an experimental implementation of the MVC. I am developing my own
blog/CMS. I don't feel like learning Wordpress, Drupal, or one of the other
blog/CMS systems out there because they are way more robust than I need.
Plus I like to build things.

I am looking to build a basic bare bones blog/CMS system that can be
easily expanded as necassary.
